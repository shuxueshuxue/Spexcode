concern: anchor-drift blocks the very commit that fixes it — the gate should let the repairing spec.md through

## What happens

`anchor-drift` is a lint ERROR, and the pre-commit hook hard-blocks on errors. But the only way to
clear an anchor-drift is to commit a new version of the drifting node's `spec.md` (or an ack, which
is also a commit). So the error blocks the one commit that repairs it. The tree cannot get out of
the state through the gate that is holding it there.

Hit live: an archive merge (53451009) left `anchor-drift ... 'session-console' v167` on `main`. The
fix — rewriting session-console's body — could not be committed until `SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1` was set
(commit 1cc12602, verified 0 errors immediately after). Meanwhile the error is tree-wide, so it was
blocking EVERY worker's next commit, not just the author's.

## Why this is a mechanism gap, not a usage problem

Reaching for the bypass is currently the only exit, which means the escape hatch is load-bearing for
an ordinary, expected repair. That is backwards: the hatch should stay reserved for genuine
emergencies, and a routine fix should pass through the front door.

## The decidable fix

The hook has everything it needs to tell repair from regression. An anchor-drift names the node it
is about, and that node's `spec.md` has a known path. So:

> if the drift-reporting node's `spec.md` is in THIS commit's staged file set, that drift must not
> block the commit.

Staged-set membership is exact — no heuristic, no guessing at intent. A commit that touches the
spec.md is by definition either rewriting the contract or stamping an ack, which are precisely the
two honest remedies the error message itself recommends. A commit that does NOT touch it is still
blocked, so the gate keeps its teeth for the case it exists to catch.

Worth checking whether the same shape applies to the other blocking rules (a commit that repairs an
`integrity` or `mention` error by editing the very node the rule names), rather than special-casing
anchor-drift alone.

on the author's behalf.
