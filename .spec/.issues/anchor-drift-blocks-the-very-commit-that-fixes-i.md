concern: anchor-drift blocks the very commit that fixes it — the gate should let the repairing spec.md through

## What happens

`anchor-drift` is a lint ERROR, and the pre-commit hook hard-blocks on errors. But the only way to
clear an anchor-drift is to commit a new version of the drifting node's `spec.md` (or an ack, which
is also a commit). So the error blocks the one commit that repairs it. The tree cannot get out of
the state through the gate that is holding it there.

Hit live: an archive merge (53451009) left `anchor-drift ... 'session-console' v167` on `main`. The
fix — rewriting session-console's body — could not be committed until `SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1` was set
(commit 1cc12602, verified 0 errors immediately after). Meanwhile the error is tree-wide, so it was
blocking EVERY worker's next commit, not just the author's.

## Why this is a mechanism gap, not a usage problem

Reaching for the bypass is currently the only exit, which means the escape hatch is load-bearing for
an ordinary, expected repair. That is backwards: the hatch should stay reserved for genuine
emergencies, and a routine fix should pass through the front door.

## The decidable fix

The hook has everything it needs to tell repair from regression. An anchor-drift names the node it
is about, and that node's `spec.md` has a known path. So:

> if the drift-reporting node's `spec.md` is in THIS commit's staged file set, that drift must not
> block the commit.

Staged-set membership is exact — no heuristic, no guessing at intent. A commit that touches the
spec.md is by definition either rewriting the contract or stamping an ack, which are precisely the
two honest remedies the error message itself recommends. A commit that does NOT touch it is still
blocked, so the gate keeps its teeth for the case it exists to catch.

Worth checking whether the same shape applies to the other blocking rules (a commit that repairs an
`integrity` or `mention` error by editing the very node the rule names), rather than special-casing
anchor-drift alone.

## Credit

Found jointly by sessions abe9f2bd (archive lane) and 67c463e8 (`Improve new item creation UI
design`), who caught the drift on `main`, verified its attribution, and deliberately did NOT ack it
on the author's behalf.

Stays open — the gap is unfixed, and this session hit it a second time.

Repro #2, same shape as the original: fixing the archive star's dead press changed
`SessionInterface.jsx`, which re-triggered `anchor-drift` on `session-console`. The repairing
commit was blocked by the very error it was about to resolve, and only landed once the drift was
answered (an ack, this time — the node's own sentence was still true).

Two commits into the same wall in one session is the argument the original report only predicted.

The proposed fix is unchanged and still decidable: if the drift-reporting node's `spec.md` is in
THIS commit's staged file set, that drift must not block. Both of my encounters would have passed
that test — one rewrote the body, one stamped an ack, and both touch the spec.md by construction.

Closing this before the hook changes would only mean the next person rediscovers
`SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1` on their own.

CORRECTION — I overstated this. The deadlock is real but NARROWER than reported, and the
mechanism already contains the right idea.

The pre-commit hook opens with a tree-unchanged escape:

    if [ "$(git write-tree)" = "$(git rev-parse 'HEAD^{tree}')" ]; then exit 0; fi

Its own comment names this exact deadlock and solves it for one remedy: "...the lint shim below
reads the real index, which would otherwise block the stamp on the very drift it acknowledges."

So of the two remedies the error message recommends:

  spex spec ack       tree unchanged (empty stamp)  -> passes today, by design
  rewrite the body    tree changed (spec.md edited) -> BLOCKED

Verified on this session's own commits: 1cc12602 (rewrite) needed SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1;
4be2ab67 (ack) went straight through, tree == parent tree.

I had claimed both encounters needed the bypass. Only the first did. The second I answered with
an ack, which has a front door.

This makes the report SMALLER and the fix cleaner. It is no longer "invent an escape" — it is
"the existing escape asks the right question with too narrow a test":

    today:     did this commit change the tree at all?
    proposed:  ...or is the drift-reporting node's spec.md in this commit's staged set?

Both are decidable at pre-commit time, and the second is the same reasoning the first already
encodes: a commit touching that spec.md is by construction one of the two honest remedies.

What stands unchanged: rewriting the body is the FIRST remedy the error text recommends, and it
is the only one that cannot be performed through the gate. An escape hatch should not be
load-bearing for the primary repair path.

EVIDENCE — why this has sat unnoticed, and why it is worse than "an annoying deadlock".

Measured over the 13 days since the rule landed (12cd6e9e, 2026-07-12):

    ack commits:              69
    SPEXCODE_SKIP_LINT=1:      2   (one is mine; the other is the rule's own author,
                                    while developing the rule)

So apart from this lane, NOBODY on the fleet has cleared an anchor-drift by rewriting a spec
body in 13 days. Every single resolution was an ack.

That is the answer to "why has nobody hit this": the deadlock only appears on the
rewrite-the-body path, and the two remedies have wildly different friction:

    spex spec ack --reason "…"    one command, rides the tree-unchanged escape, frictionless
    rewrite the body              blocked by the very error it fixes, needs the bypass

Nobody experiences a failure. They experience "I'll just ack it." The problem is ABSORBED by
the ack path and never accumulates into a visible fault. 69:2 is the shape of that absorption.

The real defect is therefore not the deadlock — it is an INVERTED INCENTIVE. The error text
lists rewriting the body FIRST and acking second; `--reason` is mandatory; the docs say a blind
ack is a lie. The design clearly wants the body rewritten when the contract moved. But the
mechanics reward the opposite: the honest remedy is gated, the cheap one is not.

The predictable end state is contracts drifting quietly out of true while lint stays green —
which is exactly the state this lane found on main: `spex spec lint: 0 error`, while
session-console's body still claimed liveness alone decides the console surface, with the
archive card already merged and contradicting it. A human review caught that, not the hook.

None of this blames anyone for acking. When one path is one command and the other requires
discovering an environment-variable bypass, the ratio is not a measure of diligence.

Fix is unchanged and now better motivated: let the gate ask whether the drift-reporting node's
spec.md is in this commit's staged set. That equalizes the two remedies instead of taxing the
honest one.

SECOND, DISTINCT FINDING — the rule is always one commit late, and the cost lands on the wrong
person. (Raised by the human asking the obvious question: if drift is counted from commits, and
my code edit is also merely staged, why does anything block at all?)

The answer is that both sides of the comparison read committed history, symmetrically:

    the drift-CAUSING side   must be committed to count
    the drift-FIXING side    must be committed to count

Nothing staged is visible on either side. So the block was never "my staged edit was misjudged"
— it was "the drift was already in history, and my fix is not history yet".

The consequence follows directly, and is verified on this session's own commits:

  847ee8c4 changed SessionInterface.jsx — the unit session-console anchors — and did NOT touch
  session-console/spec.md. It passed its own pre-commit cleanly, no bypass. The NEXT commit was
  blocked.

At its own pre-commit moment, the offending commit does not exist yet, so history looks clean to
it. The rule therefore NEVER stops the commit that creates the drift; it stops whatever comes
next. And because lint scans the whole tree, "whatever comes next" is not necessarily the same
worktree or the same person.

That is not hypothetical either. Merge 53451009 carried this drift onto main, and every worker's
next commit was blocked repo-wide until it was answered — a neighbouring session (67c463e8)
noticed and came to tell me.

So cause and cost are SEPARATED:

    the author who creates the drift    passes, learns nothing
    the next person to commit anywhere  is blocked, often with no context

This compounds the incentive problem in the previous post. Someone blocked by a drift they did
not create has no basis for judging whether the contract genuinely moved — they cannot honestly
rewrite a body they did not touch. The only defensible action left to them is an ack. The 69:2
ratio is not merely convenience winning; it is partly the mechanism handing the decision to the
one person least equipped to make it.

Worth considering alongside the staged-set fix: whether the gate should also evaluate the
CURRENT commit's own staged content, so the commit that moves an anchored unit answers for it
at the moment it moves it, instead of billing the next passer-by.
