description: "Use when the user wants pictures of the spec tree — draw the atlas, 画规格图, give node X a diagram, 给这个仓库画架构图, diagram this subtree. Chooses the nodes worth a picture, draws each one's diagram.json with spex diagram scaffold and check until it passes, and commits them with a report of what was drawn and what was skipped."

## Before you start

This skill draws with SpexCode's command line.

- Run `spex --version`. If there is no `spex`, install it once: `npm i -g spexcode@next` (Node 22 or newer).
- If the repository has no `.spec/` tree yet, adopt it: `spex init --harness <your harness>` (claude, zcode, codex,
  …). Then describe the project in its root `spec.md` and grow the child nodes worth drawing — a diagram draws a
  node's children, so the tree comes first.
- `spex guide diagram` is the manual for the format and the loop; read it once.

Draw the spec tree's pictures: one `diagram.json` beside each node's `spec.md` that is worth one.
The format, the rules and the loop for a single diagram live in `spex guide diagram` — read it before drawing.
This skill is the campaign around that loop.

1. **Scope.** The user names one node, a subtree, or the whole tree. `spex graph` lists the tree;
   `spex spec search <topic>` finds a node by what it is about.
2. **Choose what deserves a picture.** A node whose body explains how its children fit together gets an
   architecture diagram of those children. A node whose body is a process, a protocol, a data path or a
   lifecycle gets that kind instead. Skip leaves with nothing to show, and nodes that already carry a
   `diagram.json` unless the user asked for a redraw. Say what you skipped and why.
3. **Draw each node.** Go top-down, one node at a time; if your harness can run sub-agents, give each node to its
   own, handing it only that node's context — its body, its children's titles and descriptions, and these steps.
   For one node:
   - read its `spec.md` and its children's, and choose the kind from what the body spends its words on;
   - `spex diagram scaffold <node>` (add `--type <kind>` for anything but architecture);
   - draw: place the boxes, connect what the body says is connected and name each edge by what crosses it,
     group with regions, add cards, and write `meta.note` — what was folded, which relation is an inference;
   - `spex diagram check <node>`, and repair from its findings until it passes.
   Put no numbers on a picture that move on their own — node counts, drift, commit or import counts.
4. **Keep the spec honest.** What drawing reveals about the spec — a claim the code does not bear out, a
   relation the body never states — goes into an issue or your report, never into the picture.
5. **Land it.** `spex spec lint`, then commit the diagrams, together with any spec change they belong to.
6. **Report** which nodes got which kind of diagram, which were skipped and why, and anything you filed.
